## Dated September 6, 2013

Hello friends, we had some great events this week.  Yesterday was teacher's day, on 3rd it was Closing Ceremony of Communal harmony.

Oh!  I am diverting from my point.  Today I will speak about patriotism.  
But I am standing here to speak no good of patriotism.

So who is a patriot?  A person who loves his nation intensely.  
Intense feelings mould our destiny.

So what is bad about it?  Nothing!  Nothing is bad about it but something is surely wrong because of it.

A nation is related to territory, an area owned by a social group.  A patriot would care only for his country.  A soldier is considered as a true patriot.  These patriots will kill other patriots in war.  It is because of war.  But why war?  Because of territory.

In the film *Border*, a soldier says, why should I fight a war?  Why should I kill a soldier who loves his country?  He, who has done no harm to me and is a son of his mother?

So, do we actually have to kill a stranger who is serving for his country?

Isn't it the mass destruction of Communal Harmony?  And in Indians, patriotism is installed on the eve of 14th August and deactivated till by 15th night.  Many Indians believe supporting India in a cricket match displays the patriotism.  There was uncontrolled rain in [Uttarakhand](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/india-raises-flood-death-toll-reaches-5700-as-all-missing-persons-now-presumed-dead/), some heavy showers in [London](https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/23015551).  But some people desperately wanted that rain should stop in London so India could play final of ICC Champions Trophy 2013.

Next problem, differentiation.  Frankly, several people think about terrorist hearing 'Pakistan'.  Just because Al-Queda is in Pakistan?  Pakistanis are also our brothers & sisters not because first Pakistan was part of India, but we all are *homo sapiens*.

There was no India in history nor there exists any India on this earth.  
What is the difference between Indian land the rest of the world?  Is water of Indian rivers sweeter than other rivers?

Then why these boundaries?  The whole earth is one. Nobody has right to chop it.

We say religion disturbs communal harmony.  Totally wrong.  Every religion teaches you to be kind, to be honest, to help others and to respect everyone.

What does patriotism teach you?  To be unified in one country and then kill those who try to snatch your motherland.  
There is nothing called motherland.  Don't try to divide mother Earth.

And at least, don't curse religions, they help you to be good and for perfect harmony, there should exist no boundary.
